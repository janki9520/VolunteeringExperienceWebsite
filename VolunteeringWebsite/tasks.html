      <div class="desc">In order to provide a helping hand to these poor ones, we the “SANGHARSH” group took an initiative to donate unwanted clothes & other things like shoes, stationary, games etc. to underprivileged people. We held a Cloth Donation Camp for gathering clothes & other accessories from nearby societies. The collected clothes were distributed amongst the slum people, construction site families & also to the charity haat of BPA (Blind People’s Association).</div>

      <div class="desc">Some of the members from our group visited the ‘JEEVAN TIRTH’ slum area to find the hygiene problems faced by women. There we found that the women worked as replica i.e. they separated plastic metals etc. from garbage. They worked from morning 6 am till noon 2 -3 pm. They separated tons of garbage just to earn 60-70 rupees a day. They did this work with bare hands and without covering their nose. <br> <br>
      We came to a conclusion that these women did not have proper knowledge and needed counselling regarding the health issues which these ladies can face if they continued this way. So we decided to conduct our hygiene problem in slum area task in JEEVAN TIRTH for these replica’s.</div>

    <div class="desc">Hand sanitizers have become popular over the past several years. In addition to popularity, they are also an important component of a healthy lifestyle. Infections are spread by germs and bacteria, and a combination of the use of water, soap and hand sanitizer can go a long way in preventing the spread of germs. Hand sanitizer is portable and convenient when soap and water are not available, and it is often placed in stationary dispensers in places such as schools and hospitals. Hand sanitizers are available in liquid, gel or foam formulations. <br> <br>
We the members SANGHARSH group visited Thaltej Prathmic School for a survey. There we found that students were playing in mud and sand. With the same hands they ate their meals. So we decided to perform the Hand Sanitization task there as we realized that it was really needed there</div>

    <div class="desc">Initially, we took this initiative from a competition point of view. Later on, we started getting attached to each and every task that we did for the underprivileged people. The true happiness is sharing your happiness with such underprivileged people who crave for our support and little contribution. Seeing them smile gave us alot of satisfaction. This entire one month of social service gave us alot of happiness which will be remembered forever.</div>

Besides this our team members educated underprivileged families about child labor and their severe outcomes.

So the SANGHARSH Group took an initiative to install composite toilets for these families in the Juna vadaj slum. <br> <br>
“Khodiyar Traders” provided us a great support in all possible ways. They helped us in developing these toilets & that to free of cost. They also told us that Government provides free of cost toilets to families who don’t have toilets at their places. So with the support of Khodiyar traders we could install these toilets.</div>

    <div class="desc">The youth of municipal schools and underprivileged children usually have the potential to do something, but they are often deprived of proper counselling and guidance. They do have their goals set in their minds, but do not have the knowledge regarding how to reach their destination. These children usually cannot afford to go to private institutes or learn expensive courses. And due to lack of proper knowledge and guidance they drop out after their secondary and higher secondary schools. <br> <br>
In order to overcome this problem, we the members of ‘SANGHARSH’ group took an initiative to organize a career orientation program for the students of municipal schools studying in X, XI, XII standard. This programme was conducted by Mr. Maulin Pandya and our fellow members.</div>

After looking at their hidden talent, we the SANGHARSH group thought of providing these blind people a stage for showing their extraordinary talent. We organized a talent hunt event for blind with the purpose of finding out their hidden talents</div>
